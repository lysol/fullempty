<div class="post">
    <p>I'm trying something with this site: a pure Bash 4 static site generator,
    available on <a href="https://github.com/lysol/fullempty">github</a>. </p>

    <p>The syntax is simple, but a tailored specifically for this site. For example, the index page's file named <span class="code">content/index.post.sh</span> has the following structure:</p>

    <p class="code">
        docvars[date]='2019-04-22 3:53 PM CDT'<br>
        docvars[title]=fullempty.sh<br>
        docvars[content]=content/index.html<br>
        docvars[filename]=index.html<br>
    </p>

    <p>The generator makes heavy use of associative arrays. Each file matched by the glob <span class="code">contents/*.post.sh</span>
    is sourced within a loop to populate an array that is initialized with a default set of
    values (included in <span class="code">src/index.sh</span>). Each key in the array is then expanded by searching for <span class="code">&lt;% key %&gt;</span> and using sed to replace it with the value defined in the array.
    </p>

    <p>Once this step is complete, the <span class="code">content</span> value in the array is used as the body of the page, outputted to a file in <span class="code">build/</span>, using <span class="code">filename</span>'s value in the array.</p>

    <h2>Posts</h2>

    <p>Any pages with <span class="code">type</span> set to <span class="code">post</span> are treated slightly differently. They are processed normally, but also added to a tab-delimited csv named <span class="code">posts.csv</span> that is used to build a list of <span class="code">&lt;li&gt;</span> elements for later inclusion as a chronologically reversed order of post links. I intend to also build an RSS file for these posts using this index.</p>

    <h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>

    <p>I focused on a shallow dependency tree (in fact, a non-existent one).
    While this ended up being largely hassle free, the data structures available to bash
    preclude a lot of advanced transforms. If bash supported multi-dimensional arrays, that
    may have simplified a little code. The simple solution was to iterate through the list
    of files twice, which is only a little slower.</p>

    <p>I fought constant internal critiques
    on what I was doing, such as impulses to just trash the entire work and use a simple
    Python script with <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja2</a>. In the end I'm glad I
    stuck it out, though the lack of more advanced templating patterns is limiting, long term. I implemented variable expansion within other assignments in files, however, so it should be possible
    to simply create those kinds of control structures within bash scripts referenced by
    the posts themselves. My only other closing thought is the directory structure is entirely
    flat and will get messy in short order.</p>
