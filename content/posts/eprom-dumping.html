    <p>My Willem EEPROM programmer really hates 28cXXX EEPROMs, despite everything I've tried with it.
        It happily erases any EEPROM I throw in there, even if I just want to dump it, so I finally got
        around to putting together an Arduino Mega EEPROM programmer. I used the schematic and sketch
        available at <a href="http://danceswithferrets.org/geekblog/?page_id=903">The Oddbloke Geek Blog</a>, just
    using protoboard, which led to lots of cursing as the only reasonable wire I had around was 30AWG.</p>

    <p>My main goal with this is that I keep running into a need for a simple 28cXXX programmer for all sorts of projects,
        but specifically building an <a href="http://www.malinov.com/Home/sergeys-projects/isa-fdc-and-uart">8-bit ISA
        High Density Floppy Controller</a>. Burning that image took all of two minutes to do, so I pulled out a box of random ROMs I had
    kicking around and decided to dump them, and now I'm sharing them with you.</p>

    <p>They all seem to be Amiga related, but I'm not really an Amiga person, so I don't know what they are offhand.
        Some basic searching turned up references to SCSI controllers, so I assume these are some auxilliary ROMs
    for Amiga hardware. If you know what they are, or even need them, send me an <a href="mailto:derek@derekarnold.net">email</a>.</p>
